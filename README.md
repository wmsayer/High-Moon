# High-Moon
An entertainment venue that consists of arcade, bowling alley, concert venue, and wood-fire grill tucked away in the gorgeous Town of Breckenridge.

The most interesting work is the last iteration set of drawings in `Drawings and Models/Drawing Iterations` that I put together for the *proof of concept* 3D model of the building.

The remaining work for this project was ommitted for concision.
